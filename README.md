# Model Checker

![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)

A web-based application for validating IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) models against common issues and IDS (Information Delivery Specification) requirements. The Model Checker helps ensure high-quality BIM data in AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) projects.

## 🌐 Live Application

Try out the application at [https://modelcheck.opensource.construction](https://modelcheck.opensource.construction)

## ✨ Features

- **Client-side Processing**: All file processing happens in your browser using WASM technology - no data is sent to servers
- **Standard Validation**: Check IFC models against common issues like naming conventions, relationships, and more
- **IDS Validation**: Validate IFC models against custom IDS (Information Delivery Specification) requirements
- **Multiple Report Formats**:
  - View HTML reports directly in browser
  - Download BCF (BIM Collaboration Format) reports for use in other BIM tools
- **Multi-language Support**: Available in multiple languages:
  - English
  - German
  - French
  - Italian
  - Romansh
- **Browser-based Python**: Utilizes Pyodide to run Python code (IfcOpenShell and IfcTester) directly in the browser

- Node.js v20 or later
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/opensourceconstruction/model-checker.git
   cd model-checker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

## 📖 Usage

### Standard Validation

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Drag and drop your IFC file(s) onto the upload area, or click to select files
3. Click "Validate" to start the validation process
4. View the results directly in the browser, including:
   - Project, site, and building relationships
   - Element naming conventions
   - Material associations
   - Type definitions
   - And more...

### IDS Validation

1. Enable IDS validation by toggling the switch
2. Upload both your IFC file(s) and an IDS specification file
3. Select your preferred report format(s):
   - HTML Report (view in browser)
   - BCF Report (download for use in BIM tools)
4. Click "Validate" to start the process
5. Review the detailed validation results
